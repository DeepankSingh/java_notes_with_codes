## Introduction

These notes cover fundamental concepts in Java programming, including variables, data types, control flow, and more.

## Topics Covered

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if-else, loops)
- Methods and Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance)

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), compilers, and tools necessary for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java programs.

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run Java bytecode. It is responsible for interpreting Java bytecode and executing the instructions on the underlying hardware. The JVM provides platform independence, allowing Java programs to run on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM implementation.

## Tools Required

To run the Java programs included in this repository, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: You can download the JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). Make sure to install the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: You can use any text editor such as Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, or an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to write and edit Java code.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the notes to review basic Java concepts. You can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/DeepankSingh/Java-Basic-Notes.git
